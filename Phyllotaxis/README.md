# Phyllotaxis  
Phyllotaxis is the name given to way leaves or seeds are arranged in plants. Often they follow interesting shapes or patterns.  
In this example, seeds are placed outward from the center with radius r = c x sqrt(n) and angle phi = n x angle, where c and the angle are constants and n is the number of the seed being placed. This leads to interesting patterns which are very sensitive to the angle difference between each seed.
