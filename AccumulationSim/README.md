## Accumulation/Crystal Simulation

This simulation works with "crystal particles" that stick to one that's already stuck, forming a web with tendrils that reach out. A 
similar process occurs in super-saturated solutions when they are disturbed by some outside action and when middle schoolers make rock
candy.

Might run a little slowly, but by adjusting the amount of "jitter" and iterations, the simulation can be made smoother. Other parameters
include the minimum distance before the particles stick to each other and potentially even a probability of stickiness.

Inspired by Dan Shiffman's implementation, thanks Dan!
