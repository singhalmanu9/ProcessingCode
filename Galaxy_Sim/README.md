## Galaxy Simulator  
This code simulates the movement of stars and dark matter in a universe. It uses Newton's law of gravitational attraction to calculate
the force between two objects and then adjusts the acceleration for each particle accordingly. By adjusting the strength of gravity, the 
minimum distance between objects, the max speed of the objects and the masses given to the objects, one can change the results of the simulation
quite dramatically. Other parameters include the frequency of dark matter to normal stars and the distribution of matter in the universe,
which are the primary focus of this simulation.  

### Results  
From this simulation, it is pretty clear to see that the distribution of dark matter is a prominent driving factor of the number and frequency
of galactic formation in the early universe. Where is more dark matter, galaxies tend to form. The amount of dark matter also changes the 
frequency of galactic formation, as more galaxies tend to form when the concentration of dark matter in the universe is higher.

### Motivations
I originally made this simulation in Java in 2010, but I've gone and lost the code, so I remade it in Processing, which was much much faster
than dealing with graphics in Java. I originally made it as a proof of concept that my theory was correct, but I used this simulation for a 
science fair project when I ran the simulation on a supercomputer in order to scale the project up.
